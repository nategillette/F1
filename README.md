# F1
This app will be focused on accessing all historical and current information about F1. I wanted a project that allowed me to work more with API's as well as possibly learn a bit more about designing UI's. My passion for F1 and desire to work with some data that is consistenly updated, led me down this road. Hopefully, this combination will allow me to finally finish a side project =)

# Project Details
## This project will be using
### PyQt
This seemed like a logical conclusion. I wanted a language that has good HTTP support and also has a good opensource UI library. Python with PyQt seemed perfect.

## ergast API
This API seemed like the most reliable and well documented F1 API I have seen.

## Pandas
Due to the sheer volume of data, I need something that will allow me to easily handle this data.
